        <span>F</span>acial recognition technology has become increasingly common in various sectors of society, 
        from security systems to airport terminals, to phone logins. With the rapid adoption of this technology, 
        there have been concerns raised about the potential impact on privacy and civil liberties. One high-profile 
        example that has garnered international attention is the use of facial recognition technology in China 
        to monitor and control the Uyghur Muslim population. With most of the media coverage on this topic being 
        placed on foreign happenings, this seems like a problem that's far away from us. However, similar programs 
        have already been implemented right here in Southeast Michigan.

        <h1>How Project Greenlight is Using Facial Recognition Technology to Fight Crime in Southeast Michigan</h1>
        <p>Project Green Light is a public-private partnership program launched by the city of Detroit in 2016. 
         Designed to help improve public safety and reduce crime in the city by using high-definition video cameras to monitor businesses 
        and public spaces in real-time, the program was created in response to a rise in crime in Detroit, particularly in areas with high 
        concentrations of businesses.</p>
        <p>Under the program, participating businesses install high-definition cameras that are connected to a secure
        network monitored by the Detroit Police Department's Real-Time Crime Center. The cameras are positioned in such a way as to provide 
        a clear view of the business's exterior, as well as any adjacent public areas, such as sidewalks or parking lots. The cameras are 
        equipped with software that can detect suspicious activity, such as loitering or trespassing, and alert police officers in real-time.
         In addition, the cameras can be accessed by police officers in the Real-Time Crime Center, who can use them to monitor and respond to 
        incidents as they occur. Businesses that participate in the program are required to display a "Project Green Light" logo on their premises, which serves as a visible 
        deterrent to would-be criminals. Another benefit participating businesses receive is additional police support, including priority response to 
        emergency calls and increased police patrols in the area.</p>
        <p>The program has been credited with reducing crime in areas where it has been implemented. However, it has also been criticized by 
        some who argue that it represents an invasion of privacy and could potentially be used to target marginalized communities. The limitations 
        of this system was broguht to the forefront of $our minds with the arrest of the a man who was misidentified by the facial recognition systems,
        first of its kind in the United States.</p>

        <h1>The Robert Williams Case: How Facial Recognition Technology Led to a Miscarriage of Justice</h1>
        <p>Robert Williams, a Black man, was arrested in January 2020 in front of his wife and children at their home in Detroit. 
        Accused of stealing watches from a luxury goods store in downtown Detroit in 2018, the evidence against him included 
        a facial recognition match from a surveillance camera. However, Williams maintained his innocence and argued that he 
        had never been to the store in question. His case gained national attention when the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
        filed a complaint on his behalf, alleging that the use of facial recognition technology had violated his civil rights.
        The case was resolved months later in June 2020 with the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office dropped all charges against Williams, 
        citing a lack of evidence. In addition, the Detroit Police Department issued a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology
        for certain arrests, pending a review of its policies and procedures.</p>
        <p>The case of Robert Williams has raised concerns about the accuracy and bias of facial recognition technology, particularly 
        when it comes to its use in law enforcement. Critics argue that the technology is prone to errors and can disproportionately
        misidentify people of color and marginalized communities, leading to false arrests and other civil rights violations.</p>

        <h1>Regulating Facial Recognition Technology: How Michigan is Responding to Privacy Concerns</h1>
        <p>In 2019, the Michigan legislature passed a set of bills that regulate the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies 
        in the state. The bills require that law enforcement agencies obtain a search warrant before using facial recognition technology to identify
        a suspect in an investigation, except in cases of emergency. The bills also require that law enforcement agencies maintain records of their
        use of facial recognition technology and report their findings to the state legislature.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Michigan State Police, which maintains a database of driver's license photos, has implemented a policy that restricts
        the use of facial recognition technology to specific investigations, such as those involving violent crimes or threats to national security.
        The policy also requires that the use of facial recognition technology be subject to oversight and review by internal auditors.Some civil liberties groups have argued that the regulations do not go far enough to protect privacy and civil rights. They have called
        for a complete ban on the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement, citing concerns about accuracy, bias, and the potential for abuse.</p> 
        <p>The bills passed in Michigan that regulate the use of facial recognition technology are collectively known as the "Michigan Facial Recognition Act".
        Under the Michigan Facial Recognition Act, law enforcement agencies are required to obtain a warrant before using facial recognition technology to 
        identify a suspect in an investigation, except in cases of emergency. The Act also requires that law enforcement agencies maintain records of their
        use of facial recognition technology and report their findings to the state legislature.In addition, the Act requires that the Michigan State Police,
        which maintains a database of driver's license photos, implement policies and procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of facial recognition
        technology. The Act also establishes a commission to review and make recommendations on the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement in the state</p>
